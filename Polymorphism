#1 - Polymorphism is a pillar of OOP that inherits methods and alters those methods
to perform different tasks in comparison to their original method. There is Dynamic
and Static Polymorphism which can be differentiated by where the altered method is
executing as well as how the inherited method is being altered.

#2 - Polymorphism-changing the behavior of objects that allows for them to take on different 
properties and states based on context. Mostly done through methods that child classes inherit and 
then overriding and change the parameters (fruit has a color, and strawberry's color is red) 
and overloading the method to give more parameters. (strawberries are red, and they have a green stem). 
Used to make it so the code doesn't become redundant.

#3 - Polymorphism is an Object Oriented Programming language property in Java that allows you to modify 
methods that have the same name but have different behaviors whether it's overloading or overriding.
